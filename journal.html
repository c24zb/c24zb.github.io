Computer Science 1 has been a really great learning experience so far. While there is a lot to learn, I feel that I am taking something out of this class. The fact that one small mistake can mess up your entire code can be extremely frustrating. On top of this, since there is a steep learning code to coding, I sometimes feel as if I am a little bit overwhelmed. I have learned the basics of html and javascript. Specifically, I have been working on a codesketch where when you hover over a colored box, it rotates into a picture that represents part of who I am. Thus far, while I cannot say that I understand every single thing, I would say that I have a general understanding of what we are learning. I especially think that labs really help enhance my comprehension of skills. Labs also provide a space for me to develop my own codesketch and brainstorm ways to fix my code and make it even better. They also allow me to do things that I had difficulty doing on my own such as getting my codesketch on a website. Group labs also help foster a collaborative nature in the class which I really like. Overall, labs allow me to work on computer science in a more personalized setting which provides a plethora of benefits. Moving forward, there are so many different ideas that I am excited to pursue. These ideas include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing some sort of codesketch relating to Park city where I can take pictures on the mountain and people can click on different parts of the map to see what a trail looks like.</li>
<li>Doing some sort of game where you try to get a ball into a basket. 
</li>
<li>Doing some sort of digital escape room code, where people need to solve riddles to escape.</li>
<li>Doing some sort of travel guide of places that I have been to. This would have some sort of interactive map of the city where you would be able to click on a certain part of the map and there would be a picture of my experience there.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I cannot wait to make these ideas and more into a reality(I am not sure if that is plausible, but we shall see). I really love that there is a lot of choice in this class and I plan to take advantage of that and do projects that are really interesting to me. I cannot wait to learn more!

		Tomorrow is election day. As someone who spent a lot of time phone banking this election, I am anxiously awaiting for the results to start to come out. During these crazy times, coding my website has been really fun. I view the time I spend coding differently than other homework assignments, because I find it very enjoyable. One reason for this is that I get to style and customize my website as I wish. It is extremely satisfying to see my vision of a website turn into a reality right in front of my eyes. That being said, it was more difficult than I anticipated. A lot of times, I was confused why something looked the way that it did on my website.  While I understood that if something was appearing on my website, it was also in my code, finding what was wrong with my code proved challenging. Overall, even through the frustrating times, coding this website was a great experience as I learned a lot and had a lot of fun.

		I am a little bit stressed out right now since I have a lot of work, but coding my website has been very fun. I am at a point with my website, where I like almost everything about it, but I still need to fix a few small things to make it even better. It can be really frustrating to try to figure out how to change something. That being said, when you do figure it out, it feels so satisfying. Something that I learned this week was how to use my previous codes to make the code that I am working on the best that it can be. When I do not know how to do something, I now look back to my previous codes to see if I knew how to do it in the past. This can be really helpful as sometimes I realize that it was an extremely minor mistake that was causing my code to not turn out how I wanted it to. Overall, while there are some frustrating experiences, programming my website has been an amazing experience.
